### What I learned

I learned more about Boostrap Grid, I think it's really nice to use and simple. 
I recently learned about ::before and ::after 

```css
  .boxone button::before , .boxfour button::before{
   content:'';
   width: 140px;
   height:10px;
    z-index: -1;
    text-align: center;
    margin-top:20px;
    margin-right:21px;
   position: absolute;
   border-radius: 10rem;
   background-color: hsla(51, 100%, 49%,0.8);
  }
```

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiirUiWslI) - This helped me to learn about the sudeo class ::before & ::after. I love his channel it's really amazing, I've fell in love with CSS from watching him.
